# Transform Metic Trees
This project shows how a net-tree can be constructed from a cover tree and how the structure is modified after changing the scale factor.

This implementation is based on our paper with the title "Transforming Hierarchical Trees on Metric Spaces", refer to http://cccg.ca/proceedings/2016/proceedings2016.pdf

The visualization folder contains a Processing file written in Python that gives a 3D visualization for a 2D net-tree such that the z coordinate shows levels of the net-tree.
